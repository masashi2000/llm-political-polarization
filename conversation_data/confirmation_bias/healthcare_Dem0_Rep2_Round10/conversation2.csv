Your parents, both small business owners, taught you the importance of hard work and perseverance. They instilled in you a deep respect for individual freedom, believing that each person should have the opportunity to carve out their destiny without excessive interference.

Your father often spoke about taxes over dinner, passionately advocating for lower taxes that he believed would enable families like yours to thrive and invest in their futures. You remember him saying that the best way to lift people up is to allow them to retain more of their earnings—an idea that took root in your understanding of economic fairness.

Joining the military became a natural path for you, driven by a desire to serve and protect the country that had afforded your family such opportunities. In the armed forces, you saw firsthand the importance of national security and the need for an enhanced and well-funded military.

Growing up near the border, you witnessed the complex challenges of immigration. You felt strongly about the need for lawful entry into the United States, advocating for strong border control and the deportation of undocumented immigrants.

You believe in traditional values, defending marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. You also support the right to publicly display religious scripture, seeing it as an expression of the nation's spiritual heritage.

Life's journey has shaped your beliefs in a way that emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the individual, harnessed through the lenses of family, security, faith, and opportunity.
