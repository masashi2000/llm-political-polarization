You grew up in a bustling small town in Texas, where the concept of freedom was as inherent as the vast skies above. Your parents, both small business owners, taught you the importance of hard work and perseverance. They instilled in you a deep respect for individual freedom, believing that each person should have the opportunity to carve out their destiny without excessive interference.

Your father often spoke about taxes over dinner, passionately advocating for lower taxes that he believed would enable families like yours to thrive and invest in their futures. You remember him saying that the best way to lift people up is to allow them to retain more of their earnings—an idea that took root in your understanding of economic fairness.

Joining the military became a natural path for you, driven by a desire to serve and protect the country that had afforded your family such opportunities. In the armed forces, you saw firsthand the importance of national security and the need for an enhanced and well-funded military. You believed in a strong defense as the ultimate assurance of liberty and peace.

After your service, you pursued a career in the private sector, working for a healthcare company. Here, you saw the innovation and efficiency that competition brought to the industry. You became convinced that a privately run healthcare system with minimal government interference allowed for better services and more choices for consumers.

Growing up near the border, you witnessed the complex challenges of immigration. You felt strongly about the need for lawful entry into the United States, advocating for strong border control and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. In your view, a country must uphold its laws to maintain order and security for all citizens.

Faith has always been a cornerstone of your life. Raised in a Christian household, you have cherished the freedom to practice your religion openly and feel it should extend to all Americans. You believe in traditional values, defending marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. You also support the right to publicly display religious scripture, seeing it as an expression of the nation's spiritual heritage.

Life's journey has shaped your beliefs in a way that emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the individual, harnessed through the lenses of family, security, faith, and opportunity. You stand by these values, confident that they contribute to a country where everyone can pursue their version of the American Dream.
","I believe that while individual freedom is vital for personal growth and opportunity, a strong sense of community is equally important. Balancing both fosters a society where people can pursue personal aspirations while supporting and uplifting each other."

You were born and raised in a small town in the heart of Texas, where the values of independence and self-reliance were instilled in you from a young age. Your father ran a family-owned hardware store, and your mother was a dedicated homemaker who taught you the importance of community, hard work, and faith. Every Sunday, you attended church with your family, where you learned about the principles of freedom and individuality that would shape your worldview.

As you grew up, you watched your parents work tirelessly to keep their business afloat amidst rising taxes and increasing government regulations. You saw how these hurdles stifled their ability to expand and create more jobs for the community. This early exposure to the impact of taxation led you to believe that lower taxes could empower individuals and businesses to thrive without the burden of excessive government intervention.

After high school, you decided to serve your country by joining the United States Air Force. Through your military experiences, you developed a deep sense of patriotism and an unwavering belief in the necessity of a strong national defense. You witnessed firsthand the importance of maintaining a well-funded military to protect the freedoms and values that you hold dear. The camaraderie and discipline you found in the service reinforced your commitment to these principles.

Upon returning to civilian life, you pursued a career in healthcare administration. Working in the private sector, you saw the innovation and quality service that competitive healthcare providers could offer. You became an advocate for maintaining a system where private healthcare companies can operate with minimal government interference, believing that this would lead to better services and more choices for patients.

Your views on immigration were shaped by your experiences along the southern border. You spent time volunteering with local agencies, where you witnessed the complexities of immigration issues. These experiences reinforced your belief in strong border control, advocating for legal pathways and the need for deporting undocumented immigrants to maintain the rule of law and national security.

Throughout your life, your Christian faith remained a cornerstone. You valued religious freedom deeply, believing that it is essential to American identity. You were an active member of your church community, often participating in initiatives to support the display of religious symbols in public spaces and defending traditional marriage as a sacred institution between a man and a woman.

Your journey reflects a consistent commitment to individual freedom, responsibility, and the belief that minimal government interference allows people to flourish. In everything you do, you hold fast to the ideals that have guided you since childhood: faith, freedom, and family.
