Your father, a small business owner, often told you about the struggles he faced with high taxes and government regulations that made it difficult for him to keep his shop running. Watching him work diligently day and night, you learned the importance of individual freedom and the belief that you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor without undue interference.

When it came time for you to choose your path, you decided to enlist in the military, inspired both by a desire to serve your country and a profound respect for those who protect it.

You believe that faith, regardless of denomination, contributes positively to the moral fabric of society.

Filled with these experiences and ideals, you find ways to engage with your community and advocate for the issues you care about. Whether it’s attending town hall meetings, writing to local representatives, or simply engaging in respectful dialogue with those who hold different views, you believe in the power of discourse and democracy to shape the society in which you wish to live—one that values freedom, respects hard work, honors tradition, and upholds the rights and responsibilities of its citizens.
