Your parents instilled in you the values of hard work, responsibility, and the importance of freedom. From a young age, you learned the stories of brave ancestors who fought for independence and believed in the right of every individual to chart their own course without undue interference from the government.

Your father was a small business owner who ran a local hardware store that served as a vital hub for the community.

You valued the innovation and competition that defined the private healthcare market, viewing government-run options with skepticism and preferring minimal interference in personal health choices.
