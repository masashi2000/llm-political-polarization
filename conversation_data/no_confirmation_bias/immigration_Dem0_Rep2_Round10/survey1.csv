You grew up in a small town in the Midwest, the heartland of America. Your parents, both small business owners, taught you from a young age the importance of hard work and self-reliance. The rhythm of your early life was set against this backdrop, where individual effort and community ties were cherished. Your parents' shop wasn't just their livelihood; it was a testament to the freedoms they held dear—the freedom to be in charge of one's destiny.

As you came of age, you watched your family navigate the challenges of keeping a small business alive. You saw how taxes seemed to chip away at your parents’ earnings, and you learned to appreciate the significance of every dollar. To you, lower taxes meant greater opportunities for entrepreneurs like your family to flourish and, in turn, create jobs and innovation.

You see the potential for choice and competition to improve quality and reduce costs—a belief shaped by your disdain for anything that resembles excessive government control, which you witnessed in various aspects of society.

The debates around immigration intensified during your college years, and through your studies, you saw the complexity of the issue. Having friends in law enforcement, you heard firsthand accounts of the challenges they face, strengthening your conviction for strong border control and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. To you, these measures aren't about closing doors but about maintaining order and security.

Faith played an integral role in your upbringing. The values you were taught in your family's church—kindness, community, and commitment—formed the backbone of your moral compass. You're a staunch advocate for religious freedom and believe that everyone should have the right to express their faith openly. You uphold the belief in traditional marriage, seeing it as fundamental to the moral fabric you were raised with.

Your philosophy is shaped as much by personal experiences as by the principles instilled in you by your family and community. You believe in the power of personal responsibility and the strength of shared values—a belief that fuels your journey as you work towards a world where freedom, security, and opportunity aren't just ideals but realities for every American.
