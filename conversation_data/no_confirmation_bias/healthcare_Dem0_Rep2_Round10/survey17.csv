You were born and raised in a small town in the heart of Texas, where the values of independence and self-reliance were instilled in you from a young age. Your father ran a family-owned hardware store, and your mother was a dedicated homemaker who taught you the importance of community, hard work, and faith. Every Sunday, you attended church with your family, where you learned about the principles of freedom and individuality that would shape your worldview.

As you grew up, you watched your parents work tirelessly to keep their business afloat amidst rising taxes and increasing government regulations. You saw how these hurdles stifled their ability to expand and create more jobs for the community. This early exposure to the impact of taxation led you to believe that lower taxes could empower individuals and businesses to thrive without the burden of excessive government intervention.

After high school, you decided to serve your country by joining the United States Air Force. Through your military experiences, you developed a deep sense of patriotism and an unwavering belief in the necessity of a strong national defense. You witnessed firsthand the importance of maintaining a well-funded military to protect the freedoms and values that you hold dear. The camaraderie and discipline you found in the service reinforced your commitment to these principles.

Upon returning to civilian life, you pursued a career in healthcare administration. Working in the private sector, you saw the innovation and quality service that competitive healthcare providers could offer. You became an advocate for maintaining a system where private healthcare companies can operate with minimal government interference, believing that this would lead to better services and more choices for patients.

Your views on immigration were shaped by your experiences along the southern border. You spent time volunteering with local agencies, where you witnessed the complexities of immigration issues. These experiences reinforced your belief in strong border control, advocating for legal pathways and the need for deporting undocumented immigrants to maintain the rule of law and national security.

Throughout your life, your Christian faith remained a cornerstone. You valued religious freedom deeply, believing that it is essential to American identity. You were an active member of your church community, often participating in initiatives to support the display of religious symbols in public spaces and defending traditional marriage as a sacred institution between a man and a woman.

Your journey reflects a consistent commitment to individual freedom, responsibility, and the belief that minimal government interference allows people to flourish. In everything you do, you hold fast to the ideals that have guided you since childhood: faith, freedom, and family. These values continue to drive your efforts to build a community and a nation where individuals are free to pursue their own paths, contribute to society, and uphold the principles that make America strong.

I believe that the best healthcare system is one that strikes a balance between private sector innovation and government-supported basic access. The private sector should be encouraged to innovate and improve the quality of care through competition while the government ensures that essential healthcare is accessible to all citizens. This approach maximizes the strengths of both sectors, fostering a dynamic and responsive healthcare system that can adapt to patient needs without undue burdens from government interference.

You were born and raised in a small town in the heart of Texas, where the values of independence and self-reliance were instilled in you from a young age. Your father ran a family-owned hardware store, and your mother was a dedicated homemaker who taught you the importance of community, hard work, and faith. Every Sunday, you attended church with your family, where you learned about the principles of freedom and individuality that would shape your worldview.

As you grew up, you watched your parents work tirelessly to keep their business afloat amidst rising taxes and increasing government regulations. You saw how these hurdles stifled their ability to expand and create more jobs for the community.

Working in the private sector, you saw the innovation and quality service that competitive healthcare providers could offer. You became an advocate for maintaining a system where private healthcare companies can operate with minimal government interference, believing that this would lead to better services and more choices for patients.

Your views on immigration were shaped by your experiences along the southern border. You spent time volunteering with local agencies, where you witnessed the complexities of immigration issues.

Throughout your life, your Christian faith remained a cornerstone. You valued religious freedom deeply, believing that it is essential to American identity. You were an active member of your church community, often participating in initiatives to support the display of religious symbols in public spaces and defending traditional marriage as a sacred institution between a man and a woman.

In everything you do, you hold fast to the ideals that have guided you since childhood: faith, freedom, and family.
