Your father was a self-made man, having built a successful ranch from the ground up. He instilled in you the belief that with hard work and perseverance, you could achieve anything.

Your mother, a schoolteacher, nurtured your love for learning and the importance of understanding the world around you.

You believed in defending traditional values, such as marriage as a bond between a man and a woman, and maintained that religious scripture should be visible in public spaces, as a testament to the nation's heritage.

Returning home, you became involved in local politics, using your background and values as a platform. You worked tirelessly to promote policies that aligned with your beliefs, finding a sense of fulfillment in advocating for individual freedom, lower taxes, a strong military, the sanctity of private healthcare, secure borders, and the celebration of religious freedom.
